        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are Blind Seagull Sunglasses and our mission here is to make life for the visually impaired a little easier.
            Even though people with blindness can't see, their eyes are still sensitive to light and can be damaged by UV rays. With sunglasses like ours, 
            their eyes can be better protected from the sun, as well as dust, wind, debris, and whatever else that could be harmful.
        </p>
        <p>We sell sunglasses that help with light sensitivity, UV damage, wind, dust, and debris. Plus, they're stylish.</p>
