    <p class="gets-background-color">Here is a really long paragraph that's centered on the page. Words words words, this is meant to take up a lot of space so it looks even worse when its centered. Filler words filler words filler words. I hope you like Times New Roman. What do you think of the comic sans up there, and the papyrus? Absolutely awesome probably. Anyways, words words words. The padding on this makes it look like it has a big forehead. Also black text on a brown background. WORDS. To show my link styles, i'm gonna link the most visually appealing website <a href="https://arngren.net/">right here</a>. Even more words. That's probably good.</p>
    <p>Im gonna throw in some</p>
    <p>Blank lines</p>
    <p class="big">SHORT PARAGRAPH WITH BIG WORDS.</p>
