        <ul>
            <li><b>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed:</b> Went through the course page and found the client project page easily.</li>
            <li><b>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names:</b> Everything looks good, uses underscores instead of spaces where needed.</li>
            <li><b>Design:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read:</b> The words are easy to read, contrast looks good, and font sizes are readable.</li>
                    <li><b>Page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file:</b> There is a css file called style.css that has all the styles for this site.</li>
                    <li><b>CRAP:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Contrast:</b> No problems anywhere with contrast for things to read.</li>
                            <li><b>Repetition:</b> As of right now, there's only an index page. I assume there will be more repetition in the future when the other pages get finished.</li>
                            <li><b>Alignment:</b> Everything is left aligned, there haven't been many style changes as of now. But again I assume that'll change in the future.</li>
                            <li><b>Proximity:</b> The navbar elements have good proximity to each other. I don't think anything else is any different than just a basic page with no css yet.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Page has within it:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Header:</b> Yes.</li>
                    <li><b>Main:</b> Its there, but theres nothing in it.</li>
                    <li><b>Footer:</b> Yes.</li>
                    <li><b>Navbar:</b> Yes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Header has site/brand header in an h1:</b> The header has an h1 with the brand name,</li>
            <li><b>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and doesn't include the name:</b> There's nothing on the page yet so there's no h2. The other two pages that I can access are completely blank right now, so those also don't have an h2.</li>
            <li><b>Page has brand tagline somewhere: </b> No tagline yet.</li>
            <li><b>Page has footer with: </b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Menu for users pages:</b> It has the link to the design firm, but no other ones. That link doesn't work though.</li>
                    <li><b>Page has html validation:</b> It has the html tag and accumulus both. It verifies with no issues.</li>
                    <li><b>Page has css validation:</b> It has the css tag and accumulus too. It also verifies with no issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Page has specific requirements for assignment:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Develop functional HTML and CSS for 5 pages:</b> Has 4 pages, but 3 of them don't have anything yet. The one with content doesn't have anything in main.</li>
                    <li><b>Home page with content named index.html:</b> Done</li>
                    <li><b>Navigation bar: </b> Its there but needs one more link.</li>
                    <li><b>Content on 4 other pages:</b> Theres no content on 3 of the 4 pages I can access. Still needs one more too.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Other things I noticed:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>After looking through the github repo, I can see that most of the html and css is set up, just not implemented yet. Once content is added I think it'll look good. Also make sure to update your design firm link so it works. And I don't think you need to have the html/css buttons and accumulus, just one or the other.</li>
