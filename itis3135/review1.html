        <ul>
            <li><b>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed:</b> There wasn't a link to this page on the course page, I had to look through the repo to find the url.</li>
            <li><b>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names:</b> Everything looks good.</li>
            <li><b>Design:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read:</b> The words on the site are very easy to read, font sizes fit well, contrast is there, nothing is hard to see.</li>
                    <li><b>Page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file:</b> There is a css file called style.css that has all the styles for this site.</li>
                    <li><b>CRAP:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Contrast:</b> No problems anywhere with contrast for things to read, but the navbar is close to the same color as the header, so it doesn't stand out that much. But there is a gradient on the header, so it's a bit easier to see on the right.</li>
                            <li><b>Repetition:</b> The overall design is consistent, repeating the same format colors, fonts, and picture styles.</li>
                            <li><b>Alignment:</b> Everything is aligned nicely, looks organized, content flows the way a readers eyes would follow a page.</li>
                            <li><b>Proximity:</b> Elements that relate to eachother are all closer together than ones that don't. For example the p elements under the headings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Page has within it:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Header:</b> Yes.</li>
                    <li><b>Main:</b> Yes.</li>
                    <li><b>Footer:</b> Yes.</li>
                    <li><b>Navbar:</b> Yes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Header has site/brand header in an h1:</b> Brand header, in h1, the page name is in the header. Each page title has the site name and page name separated by a divider.</li>
            <li><b>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and doesn't include the name:</b> Each page except gallery has the name as an h2. Gallery is and h3. The only one that has the name of the brand in it is the home page, but I feel like it fits there. </li>
            <li><b>Page has brand tagline somewhere: </b>There's a tagline on the home page, but not every page. I would move it to the header.</li>
            <li><b>Page has footer with: </b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Menu for users pages:</b> It has links to the design firm and the fcc certification, but not all the pages.</li>
                    <li><b>Page has html validation:</b> I don't see the validation anywhere.</li>
                    <li><b>Page has css validation:</b> No validation yet.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Page has specific requirements for assignment:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Develop functional HTML and CSS for 5 pages:</b> Done</li>
                    <li><b>Home page with content named index.html:</b> Done</li>
                    <li><b>Navigation bar: </b> Done</li>
                    <li><b>Content on 4 other pages:</b> Done</li>
                    <li><b>Who what where when why: </b> Done, looks like it was used to figure out what the other 4 pages would be.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Other things I noticed:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall I think this is a good site. It looks professional, has the assignment requirements, and is easy to read and navigate through. The only things I'd make changes to are the navbar color and Gallery h3 to an h2. Also make sure to add accumulus.</li>
