            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> My name is Ben and i'm from Apex NC. I came to Charlotte a couple years ago for school. I have a dog that I love very much. In my spare time I like to watch sports, play video games, and play with my dog.</li>

            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows 11 laptop.</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking &amp Why:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 Web Design - </b>Major Requirement. Plus it would be cool to know how to make a website</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3146 Intro to Operating Systems - </b> Major requirement. Learning about operating systems is important.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 3160 Databases - </b>I'm pretty sure this is also a major requirement. I also heard that it was easy. So hopefully I won't have a hard time this semester.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 3153 Intro to AI - </b>Since the world is sort of shifting direction towards AI, I thought it would be a good idea to take this class.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3130 Human Centered Computing - </b>I'm pretty sure this is an elective but I heard it was easy too.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: </b>I'm color blind. In my 20 years of life and telling people that, 100% of them point to something and ask me what color it is.</li>
        </ul>
