            <h3>Good - <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a></h3>
            <p>The home page of the site has a black background with white and light gray text. It has a navbar at the top for all of its services, and buttons for contacting, logging in, and signing up. The main section has a big graphic, big buttons for things you might want to create, with different colored hover effects that correspond to each function. Also when you hover, the graphic changes to something that relates to that function. When you scroll down, you see its new AI features and how it works. It has a similar button/graphic thing, except the buttons are formatted a little differently. Then in the footer, it just contains a bunch of links. </p>
            <p><b>CRAP Princliples:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> Black background with white/light gray text makes it very easy to read, the hover colors on the buttons are bright so they also stand out.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition:</b> Repeated their button, link, and graphic formats in different sections (main section and AI features section). The buttons themselves are also repeated. </li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> It has a two column grid layout, with the left column being text (with buttons) and the right being the big graphic. Further down, the AI features heading is centered, then it goes back to the two columns.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity:</b> It groups related features together. Also, its use of whitespace helps important elements stand out more.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bad - <a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
            <p>This page is a cluttered mess of pictures and words. I think it has a navbar at the top, I can see a search bar, but pretty much every piece of text on the page looks like it could be a link. I think this site sells vehicles, judging off the pictures. There are overlapping elements, small pieces of text, some things have an outline, and the footer is just a christmas background.</p>
            <p><b>CRAP Principles:</b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> For the most part, the contrast is actually pretty good. The text is dark colors and the background is light. However, in some of the pictures with text overlapping, its hard to read. Blue words on a brown/gray picture for example.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition:</b> Elements repeat a ton, but the sections don't at all. Its just a big jumble of pictures and words. I can't tell where the different sections end and others start. Theres a link list just sitting there.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> Nothing is aligned whatsoever. Again, big jumbled mess.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity:</b> Everything is too close to each other. There is virtually zero whitespace, and things are overlapping.</li>
            </ul>
