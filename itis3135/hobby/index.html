            <h2>The Jersey Collecting Hobby</h2>
            <p>Sports fans show their passion for their teams in many different ways, and one of the most common ways is by buying a jersey. More than just a shirt, it's a way to connect with sports, teams, history, and players. Collectors show their fandom by  connecting with other fans, collectors, and community members by wearing their jerseys out, sharing their collection, and spending a ton on a shirt you wear a couple times a year.</p>
            <p>Some people like repping their favorite team or player, while others will go for 32 jerseys to get one from each team in the league. Some people have coat racks full of jerseys, some have one in their closet or hung on their wall. Regardless of our motives and collection so far, jersey collecting is something any sports fan can easily get into.</p>

            <h2>My Collecting History</h2>
            <div class="image-row">
                <p>Playing sports growing up, I always had an interest in jerseys, especially when they had good stitching. As I grew up and out of the playing side of things, I got really into watching my favorite teams - the Pittsburgh Pirates (MLB), and my hometown's Carolina Hurricanes (NHL).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Alvarez_Front.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Pirates Home jersey from when they were good (2013)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Necas_Front.jpg">
                    <figcaption>The Hurricanes current Home jersey, their alternates from 2018-2023</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Pretty soon after, I got a job, and I started to get some money. It was the summer, so I was watching the Pirates, who are terrible. Have been for years. If I was gonna get a jersey, I was gonna get one from a legend. So I did, a 1971 Roberto Clemente replica.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Clemente_Back.jpg">
                <figcaption>Clemente Jersey, replica of the 1971-76 Home uniforms.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In the NHL, the Hurricanes were finally starting to play well for like the first time in 10 years, so me and my family decided we should finally go back to watch a game in person. At that point, I grew out of all my old Hurricanes merch because they were bad and there was no reason to buy anything else. So I decided I was gonna buy a jersey.</p>
            <p>My first jersey was a regular replica Sebastian Aho home jersey. It was nice, lasted me a good year or so of wearing to games, but everyone had one. Aho was easily the best player, and the replicas are definitely more affordable than the good stuff. I knew if I spent a little more and went after a lesser known player, I'd feel cooler. I. So on black friday, with all the fun sales, I got another one - a Martin Necas black alternate (this was before he became the goat). Then one thing led to another, the Canes were playing in the Stadium Series, and I had to get one of those. So I did. A Jaccob Slavin, also authentic.</p>
            <div class="image-row-3">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Aho_Back.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Hurricanes used this as their home jersey up until the beginning of the 23-24 season.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Necas_Back.jpg">
                    <figcaption>This is the old alternate, now the home</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>The Canes wore these in the 2023 Stadium Series</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>This big wave of hockey jerseys led right into baseball season, where I thought, I should totally get another Pirates jersey. Authentic baseball jerseys go for like $400, so I decided to go the used route. I got a 2013 Home Pedro Alvarez for like $80 (absolute steal). Also, as a collector, I spend a lot of time on markets like eBay and Marketplace, and I found an old Pirates Camo jersey for 10(!) dollars. Couldn't pass it up.</p>
            <div class="image-row">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Alvarez_Back.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Alvarez had 100 RBIs in 2013, when this jersey was first bought</figcaption>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/PiratesCamo_Front.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Why is "Pirates" floating</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>As I got deeper and deeper into the hobby, I was after some very hard-to-find jerseys. What I could do, is find blanks, and send them to customizers. That's what I did for a Whalers Andrei Svechnikov and a 2010 Pirates Lastings Milledge. No one is selling these, so I spent an absolutely absurd amount of money to send them in and get them professionally customized.</p>
            <div class="image-row">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Svech_Back.jpg">
                    <figcaption>The Canes wear Whalers uniforms once a year, honoring the franchises roots</figcaption>

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Lastings Milledge became an inside joke between me and my friends, so I had to get this</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>That's about where the collection stands for now, apart from a few that don't really fit into this story. I still have plenty on my list, scouting sellers all over the internet. This collection is just getting started.</p>

            <h2>When Should You Collect?</h2>
            <p>Since the hobby is build around sports, you'd think it's seasonal. Lucky for us collectors, you can buy and sell jerseys any time of the year. Baseball in the winter, hockey and football in the summer, soccer whenever soccer isn't going on (I don't follow soccer) or whatever sport when it's out of season. </p>

            <p>As you can see, jersey collecting can be done at any time throughout the year. However, if you want to collect during a certain season, it's completely up to you. You can put an restrictions you want on it, it's your hobby and your collection.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="locations">
            <h2>Where to Collect</h2>
            <p>There are plenty of "locations" for collecting. Obviously, you can go to the stadium or arena to show off parts of your collection, or just wear your jerseys out to lunch. It's up to you where you wanna wear them. On top of physical locations, there are some online communities that I'd also like to include here. There are facebook groups, subreddits, instagram channels, and so many more places that are great locations where collectors can link up, buy/sell, and share their collections.  </p>

            <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
            <p>Like most hobbies, there's more than one way to get into it. You might see a game and think the jerseys are cool. You might look at be a player and keep your old jerseys. You might be jealous of your cousins collection. Whatever it might be, it's not a hard hobby to get into.</p>
            <p>While this is definitely not the only way to do it, I came up with some simple steps for any beginners:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Buy a jersey for your favorite team. All collections start with 1.</li>
                <li>Wear it to a game, or just around</li>
                <li>Research jerseys. The more you see, the more likely you are the think they're sick.</li>
                <li>Find other fans, talk jerseys with them</li>
                <li>Join online communities to see and share</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why Jersey Collecting?</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons to get into jersey collecting, including nostalgia from retro jerseys, connection to your team, but most importantly, I think, the access to the community. Jersey collectors love sharing with eachother, whether it be from buying what they're selling, finding other fans of your teams, or just being complimented by another person in a sick jersey.</p>
