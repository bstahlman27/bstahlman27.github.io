        <h3>Project Name: THE BOMB Tutoring and Taxes</h3>
        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>This website is for my friend Atom who is a tutor and tax preparer at Penn State. The site will let students learn about him, see the services he offers, and make appointments</p>
        <p>It will have a home page that links to the services, the about page with his bio and experience, a tutoring page with the subjects he tutors, a taxes page with his services and what to bring to an appointment, and the contact/schedule page to reach him and see availability.</p>
        <p>Intended audience is PSU students.</p>

            </li>
            <li>Users can enter a lot here, including the contact atom form, select their location, and interact with the calendar to find open slots. When they pick a time, it will take them to another form where they can enter appointment details.</li>
            <li>The only links on this page will be to the book appointment form, which will appear after they select a time slot</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dynamic Function on the Website</h3>
        <p>A lot of the site is gonna be information heavy, so the interactive part will only be on one page. The contact/schedule page will have a form for contacting Atom about general information, not scheduling (yet). That will be in a calendar with jquery where users pick a time slot and itll take them to a form that they can submit to confirm their email. The forms will go to him, then when he confirms them, the calendar will update to show that slot as unavailable for everyone else. Also, it will have a map with locations that he meets at pointed out.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.firehousesubs.com/store-locator/service-mode">Firehouse Subs Locations Page:</a> The Map will be like this, where it shows Penn States campus and points out locations that atoms mainly meets at, like the library, math building, etc.</p>
        <p><a href="https://instructure.charlotte.edu/calendar#view_name=month&view_start=2025-03-28">Canvas Calendar:</a> The calendar will be like the canvas calendar, with the current date always making sure it shows the right thing.</p>
        <p><a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#/account-help/i-can-t-remember-my-paid-account-login/">Grammarly Support Requests:</a> The form will be something like this, the part on the right that asks if you still need help. It will be to the side, next to the map</p>
